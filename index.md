## Projects

### Key Factors and Aviation Laws Influencing Airport Supply Chain Management
**Project Brief:**  
This project explores the impact of aviation laws on airport supply chain management (SCM), with a focus on fuel supply, maintenance services, ground operations, and passenger transportation. Using a quantitative, survey-based approach, the study collects data to examine the effectiveness of these regulations in supporting airport SCM. Data analysis in SPSS, including correlation and regression techniques, reveals how aviation policies shape SCM practices, identifying both supportive and problematic policies.

**Key Findings:**  
- Many aviation policies positively impact SCM, though certain regulatory gaps present operational challenges within airports.  
- Addressing these gaps can enhance supply chain efficiency, benefiting stakeholders and policymakers focused on optimizing airport operations.
